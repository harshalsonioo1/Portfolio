                    Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a satellite-based imaging technique which has been used to learn about earth's surface and sub-surface movements. It can measure earth's displacements by comparing phase information from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images taken at different points in time. But, due to high level of noises from scatterers, the wrapped phases are distorted. Estimating the coherence of SAR image pair becomes rather important in this situation to denoise them and extract useful information from it. In our research, traditional methods of oversegmentation called Super Pixeling was performed in multiple levels, to capture the local as well as non-local coherence of images. The initial level of super pixeling was performed using SLIC [10] and Felzenszwalb's [11] algorithm and the second level using K-means clustering algorithm. We performed our tests on two datasets with 0.1 to 0 left to right and 0.3 fixed noise levels respectively. Our results show that, on the dataset with higher noise, our proposed method with best tuned parameters gave a mean-squared error(MSE) of 0.0157 which is 1.9 times better than the widely used traditional method called Boxcar (sliding window) which has an MSE of 0.0302. Also, it presented 30% more structural similarity of the coherence estimates compared to that of Boxcar. Our proposed method has outperformed even the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) learning-based approach [7] which gave a higher mean-squared error of 0.0299. Thus, our proposed approach estimates coherence between two SAR images, in a more robust and accurate way, compared to the existing traditional as well as learning-based state-of-the-art methods.

                    The advancements in communication technologies will open new frontiers in the domain of teleconferencing and video conferencing. Current applications of video conferencing are solely based on streaming 2D videos over the network. However, the new research towards 360 o video transmission has the potential to revamp the video calling experience. We are the pioneers in this domain by creating a mobile application that coalesces stereoscopic Virtual Reality (VR) video streaming and monoscopic video streaming on the same platform using the same 360 o video. The application is powered by Android on the client-side and PANO [1] video streaming strategy on the server-side. We have empowered the entire application to support multiple clients by orchestrating the entire server on Kubernetes [2] and Docker [3] containers on our local machine. Our evaluation has suggested that our application can run even in poor network conditions, just under 10 Mbps network link. Our optimizations to PANO streaming strategy for teleconferencing application saves bandwidth consumption up to 38% compared to the original 360 o videos and up to 46% compared to PANO baseline version.</p>

                    The proliferation of computer vision techniques has kindled multiple applications that facilitate computers to detect humans as well as provide smart services. Estimating 3D spatial coordinates of the skeleton in real-time with reasonable latency using a single RGB image is the motivation behind this work. We are considering image processing as well as a multi-layer neural network-based approach as the modus operandi. The image processing method titled "Multi-Person human pose estimation over inaccurate bounding boxing" has four major components in its architecture [1]: Symmetric Spatial Transformer Network (SSTN), Parametric Pose Non-Maximum-Suppression (NMS), Pose-Guided Proposals Generator (PGPG), and Non-parametric Pose Lifter. This method is able to handle inaccurate bounding boxes and redundant detection, allowing it to achieve 80.7 mAP on the MPII (multi-person) data-set [2]. The multi-layer neural network approach is implemented in a unique way to avoid the extensive training time by taking 2D points as an input rather than raw images and perform end-to-end learning to 3D pose points. Neural network-based 2D pose estimators have an exceptionally well accuracy and 2D points are easily derived for our network from it. This facilitates us to train the entire Human 3.6M data-set [3] on a single GPU because of the low-dimensionality.</p>

                   The developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence has instigated extensive research in computer vision to enable the detection of objects adhering autonomy and accuracy. In this work, we propose a technique to estimate the 6D poses of the Texture-less objects using a deep neural network. The network is trained on a T-Less dataset to estimate 3D transnational and 3D rotational pose estimates. However, fundamental properties of the objects, environment encompassing the object, and media to capture them poses a challenge to estimate the pose of the object; our work also includes a pose refinement technique in which our network iteratively refine the estimates by taking cosine similarity between observed image and the rendered image.

                    In recent days, medical image registration is considered a valuable assistant for radiologists. They assist the radiologists in the diagnosis, deciding the required treatments regarding the patient's condition. There are various applications in the Marketplace that visualize these medical images of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Image) and CT (Computed Tomography) into a 3D model. The aim of this paper is to develop a mobile application that will help to meet these objectives by enabling the doctors to visualize the brain along with its parts in 3D and by automatically segmenting important parts of the brain. This tool will also provide multiple visualization tools in real-time for the efficient understanding of a patient's scan, for example, color functions, different view-projection of the brain, rendering intensities [11].</p>
